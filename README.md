# Free-Bagels-Program

I got tired of taking the 20-question survey for 2 free bagels at Einstein's Bagels, so I made a progam that uses Tesseract and Selenium 
to scan a code from a receipt, take a survey, and give me the confirmation code to write on the receipt. Turns a 30 minute process
into a 1 minute process. 
I'd like to make it a mobile app at some point for myself.
